# TDD training
This repo is meant for educational purposes.

## Introduction
In this repository, you will find moderate complexity projects to help you gain skills in Test Driven Development.

All projects are decomposed in sub-projects, each one introducing a new requirement. We intend by that to make these projects feel like working in a real agile environment.

We introduce progressively the main concepts and tools commonly used in TDD.
* JUnit (of course)
* AssertJ
* Mokito (what else)

But not only... We hope to bring front some clean code concepts, like single responsibility, immutability, concision and least complexity (YAGNI).

## Why TDD
Test Driven Development is a fantastic method that helps you to build clean, dependable and robust software. It's a must do!

### Good test coverage
By going from requirement to requirement, that is by adding complexity to your apps, you'll find blessed to have a full test coverage. In ideal TDD, when something goes wrong in your app, then you can be sure that the root cause lies in something you wrote not too long ago, because what was written before has been thoroughly tested.

Of course, this is ideal. Reality can be much more complex. However, testing DOES help troubleshoot bugs.

### Living documentation
Apart from that, well written tests are also use cases that help you understand how an application works. As such, tests stand for a living documentation.
