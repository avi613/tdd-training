# DLA - Diffusion Limited Aggregation

DLA or Diffusion Limited Aggregation is a well studied problem in computational Physics.

Let a *particle* be at any point of a two dimensional grid. Let another particle move randomly on the vertices of the grid. When the second particle *touches* the first one, it stops. Let now a third particle move as the second one. When the third particle touches any of the first two particles, it stops. Repeat until the stock of particles is emptied.

At the end of the simulation, the set of particles forms a fractal structure.

This simulation does not correspond to any problem of real life. however, many physicists considered it a worthy case to study for learning purposes.
