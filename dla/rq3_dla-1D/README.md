# Requirement 3, particle random wald on a 1D grid with an aggregation ending condition

 * let a Particle be a point on a 1 dimensional grid, say relative integers
 * initial position can be any where on the grid
 * the particle moves randomly on the nodes of the grid
 * the particle stops when it reaches a final position
 * final position is given in input of the simulation
