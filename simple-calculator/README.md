# Simple Calculator

This Kata is a free adaptation of the simple calculator kata.

We start by adding a list of numbers as string, separated by commas, like in `1,2`. This shall be our first requirement.

Our second requirement shall be to be able to perform any operation performed on integer that computes to an integer, namely addition, subtraction and multiplication.

Although, this kata is technically simple, we introduce several notions on our path to craftsmanship:
 1. Drive your devs by tests (TDD)
 2. Keep the code as simple as your requirement allows (YAGNI)
 3. Refactor your code **BEFORE** introducing a new functionality
